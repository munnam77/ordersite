### Project Plan: Ordering Site Development

#### Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop a simple, secure web-based ordering system where authenticated users (store staff) can log in, specify quantities for predefined schedules, and submit orders. No product selection is required—only quantities per schedule.
- **Target Launch**: April 2025 (assuming a 2–3 week development cycle starting late March 2025).
- **Budget**: 50,000–70,000 JPY.
- **Core Features**:
  - User authentication (login/logout).
  - Schedule-based quantity input form.
  - Order submission with confirmation.
  - Admin panel for managing schedules and viewing orders.
- **Enhancements** (beyond basic request):
  - Basic data validation and error handling.
  - Mobile-responsive design.
  - Simple reporting for admins (e.g., total orders per schedule).

---

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup (2 Days)
#### Objectives:
- Define the project scope, finalize requirements, and set up the development environment.
- Ensure alignment with the client’s provided specification and data.

#### Tasks:
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Review the client’s request and provided data (e.g., admin/store/schedule tables).
   - Confirm assumptions:
     - Users are store staff with unique login credentials.
     - Schedules (e.g., "4/7週") are predefined by the admin.
     - No product catalog—just quantities per schedule.
   - Clarify with client (if possible): Delivery date, comments, and vehicle fields usage.

2. **Technical Stack**:
   - **Backend**: PHP with Laravel (as requested, leveraging its authentication, ORM, and routing features).
   - **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap (for responsive design), minimal JavaScript for form validation.
   - **Database**: MySQL (based on provided table structure).
   - **Server**: Use client-provided server and domain.

3. **Database Design**:
   - Use the provided tables:
     - `admins` (admin login).
     - `stores` (store details and login credentials).
     - `schedules` (schedule names and total quantities).
     - `orders` (store-specific order details: `store_id`, `schedule_id`, `p_quantity`, etc.).
   - Add indexes for performance (e.g., `store_id`, `schedule_id`).

4. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up Laravel project (`composer create-project laravel/laravel order-site`).
   - Configure `.env` with client-provided server details (database, domain).
   - Install dependencies: Laravel Authentication (`laravel/ui`), Bootstrap.

#### Deliverables:
- Project scope document.
- Initial Laravel project setup with database schema.

---

### Phase 2: Design and Development (7–9 Days)
#### Objectives:
- Build a functional, user-friendly site with authentication, order input, and admin management.

#### Tasks:
1. **Authentication System** (2 Days):
   - Use Laravel’s built-in authentication scaffolding.
   - Create two user roles:
     - **Admin**: Manages schedules and views all orders.
     - **Store User**: Submits orders for their store.
   - Map provided `login_id` and `login_password` fields to Laravel’s auth system.
   - Implement logout and session management.

2. **Frontend Design** (2 Days):
   - **Login Page**: Simple form with `login_id` and `password` fields (Bootstrap styling).
   - **Store Dashboard**: 
     - Display available schedules (e.g., "4/7週", "4/14週") with input fields for quantities.
     - Submit button with confirmation prompt.
   - **Admin Dashboard**: 
     - List schedules with total ordered quantities.
     - Option to add/edit schedules.
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness using Bootstrap grid system.

3. **Backend Development** (3–4 Days):
   - **Models and Relationships**:
     - `Admin`, `Store`, `Schedule`, `Order` models with Eloquent ORM.
     - Relationships: `Store hasMany Orders`, `Schedule hasMany Orders`.
   - **Controllers**:
     - `AuthController`: Handle login/logout.
     - `OrderController`: Manage order submission (store users).
     - `ScheduleController`: Manage schedules (admin).
   - **Routes**:
     - `/login`, `/logout`.
     - `/dashboard` (store user order form).
     - `/admin` (admin panel).
   - **Validation**:
     - Quantity must be numeric and ≤ `p_total_number` per schedule.
     - Prevent duplicate submissions for the same store/schedule.

4. **Database Seeding**:
   - Populate initial data from provided tables (e.g., 10 stores, 7 schedules).

#### Deliverables:
- Functional authentication system.
- Responsive frontend for store and admin users.
- Backend logic for order submission and schedule management.

---

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement (3–4 Days)
#### Objectives:
- Ensure the site is bug-free, secure, and meets client expectations.

#### Tasks:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test authentication (valid/invalid credentials).
   - Test order submission (valid/invalid quantities, duplicate prevention).
   - Test admin functionality (schedule CRUD operations).

2. **UI/UX Testing**:
   - Verify responsiveness on desktop and mobile.
   - Check form validation feedback (e.g., “Quantity exceeds limit”).

3. **Security**:
   - Use Laravel’s CSRF protection (included by default).
   - Hash passwords in the database.
   - Restrict admin routes to admin users only.

4. **Client Feedback**:
   - Deploy to a staging environment on the client’s server.
   - Share demo credentials (e.g., admin: `admin1/password1`, store: `1/001_abc`).
   - Incorporate feedback (e.g., adjust UI or add minor features like order history).

#### Deliverables:
- Tested and secure application.
- Staging deployment for client review.

---

### Phase 4: Release and Deployment (2 Days)
#### Objectives:
- Launch the site on the client’s production server and ensure it’s ready for use.

#### Tasks:
1. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy to client’s production server via Git or FTP.
   - Run migrations to set up the database (`php artisan migrate`).
   - Configure production `.env` (e.g., `APP_ENV=production`, disable debugging).

2. **Documentation**:
   - Provide a user guide:
     - How store users log in and submit orders.
     - How admins manage schedules.
   - Include admin credentials and basic troubleshooting (e.g., password reset).

3. **Handover**:
   - Share source code with the client (via Git repository or zip file).
   - Confirm site is live and functional.

#### Deliverables:
- Live site on the client’s domain.
- User guide and source code.

---

### Phase 5: Post-Launch Support (Ongoing, Optional)
#### Objectives:
- Offer continuous development and maintenance as requested.

#### Tasks:
1. **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues reported post-launch.
2. **Enhancements**:
   - Add order history for store users.
   - Implement email notifications for order confirmation.
   - Expand admin reporting (e.g., export orders to CSV).
3. **Agreement**: Propose a monthly retainer (e.g., 10,000 JPY/month) for ongoing support.

#### Deliverables:
- Bug-free site.
- New features as agreed with the client.
